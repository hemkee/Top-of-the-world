  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

        <p><strong>Most exhilarating experience!!!</strong> <br><br> Flying in the hot air balloon was one of the foremost entries of 
        my bucket list. Most enjoyable moment. Got to see the beautiful landscape and green Panorama of Goa. Our <strong>
           India  </strong>is really beautiful.
        <br><br>
        The day began in the early hours of the morning at 6:30am at the Assolda Football Grounds in Chandor. We watched the balloon being 
        prepared for flight (which takes almost an hour) as we received a short safety briefing and the do’s and don’ts of hot air
         balloon travel. It's a mammoth 
        task to get the enormous balloon into action and takes almost 10 people to control it. 
        The pilot and crew are professionally trained and ensure that strict safety norms are followed. The total in-air time is 
        approximately 1 hour. The route of the flight totally depends direction of the wind on that day. Flights are subject to 
        favorable weather conditions, and there a chance of cancellation if weather does not permit.
        <br><br> We were awe inspired by our Pilot 
        Mrs.Reetu Yadav. A fearless lady with a great sense of humour, she maneuvered the balloon with ease and precision. We flew
        for 45 minutes and landed 8 kms away in a field. It's a 360-degree Bird's eye view from a peak elevation of 2000ft
        was across the sun-kissed fields, delicate Mandovi river and bold mountains covered by silver lined clouds. The warmth 
        from the morning sun is a joy beyond comparison. We also spotted an American Eagle flying majestically beneath us. We felt 
        like small kids waving to the cheerful natives exchanging morning greetings !!

        There is much more to narrate but I feel all of you should experience the fun yourself.
